# SurrealMl

This package is for storing machine learning models with meta data in Rust so they can be used on the SurrealDB server.

## What is SurrealML?

SurrealML is a feature that allows you to store trained machine learning models in a special format called 'surml'. This enables you to run these models in either Python or Rust, and even upload them to a SurrealDB node to run the models on the server

## Prerequisites

1. A basic understanding of Machine Learning: You should be familiar with ML concepts, algorithms, and model training processes.
2. Knowledge of Python: Proficiency in Python is necessary as SurrealML involves working with Python-based ML models.
3. Familiarity with SurrealDB: Basic knowledge of how SurrealDB operates is required since SurrealML integrates directly with it.
4. Python Environment Setup: A Python environment with necessary libraries installed, including SurrealML, PyTorch or SKLearn (depending on your model preference).
5. SurrealDB Installation: Ensure you have SurrealDB installed and running on your machine or server

## New Clients

We have removed `PyO3` for a raw dynamic C lib written in rust. This is how working with Python and we can also link this dynamic C lib to other languages such as JavaScript. The new `Python` client is housed in the `clients`
directory. Please visit this for the updated installation and API docs.
